      "Raw       : Technical progress in the open-source self replicating rapid prototyper (RepRap) community has enabled a distributed form of additive manufacturing to expand rapidly using polymer-based materials. However, the lack of an open-source metal alternative and the high capital costs and slow throughput of proprietary commercialized metal 3-D printers has severely restricted their deployment. The applications of commercialized metal 3-D printers are limited to only rapid prototyping and expensive finished products. This severely restricts the access of the technology for small and medium enterprises, the developing world and for use in laboratories. This paper reports on the development of a<$2000open-source metal 3-D printer. The metal 3-D printer is controlled with an open-source micro-controller and is a combination of a low-cost commercial gas-metal arc welder and a derivative of the Rostock, a deltabot RepRap. The bill of materials, electrical and mechanical design schematics, and basic construction and operating procedures are provided. A preliminary technical analysis of the properties of the 3-D printer and the resultant steel products are performed. The results of printing customized functional metal parts are discussed and conclusions are drawn about the potential for the technology and the future work necessary for the mass distribution of this technology.\n",

      "Raw       : Abstractive dialogue summarization is a challenging task for several reasons. First, most of the key information in a conversation is scattered across utterances through multi-party interactions with different textual styles. Second, dialogues are often informal structures, wherein different individuals express personal perspectives, unlike text summarization, tasks that usually target formal documents such as news articles. To address these issues, we focused on the association between utterances from individual speakers and unique syntactic structures. Speakers have unique textual styles that can contain linguistic information, such as voiceprint. To do this, we used ad-hoc analysis to explore speakersâ€™ text styles and constructed a syntax-aware model by leveraging linguistic information (i.e., POS tagging), which alleviates the above issues by inherently distinguishing utterances from individual speakers. Our approach allows for both data and model-centric investigation. Also, we employed multi-task learning of both syntax-aware information and dialogue summarization. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first method to apply multi-task learning to the dialogue summarization task. Experiments on a SAMSum corpus (a large-scale dialogue summarization corpus) demonstrated that our method improved upon the vanilla model. Consequently, we found that our efforts of syntax-aware approach have been reflected by the model.\n",

      "Raw       : The electromagnetic (EM) properties of two-component mixtures involving many disordered regularly and irregularly shaped crystals are studied. The effective relative permittivities are calculated utilizing the time-domain finite integration technique. The effective permittivity of disordered mixtures deviates from established mixing theories especially in cases of high permittivity contrast between inclusions and matrix material, and is strongly correlated to the cross-sectional area of the inclusion crystals. Electric energy density localizes at the edges and corners of inclusions in a manner independent of inclusion shape and influenced by EM propagation direction and surrounding inclusions. For mixtures with both disordered irregular and more organized cube inclusions, energy localization increases as the EM signal travels through the mixture before decreasing due to attenuation of the propagating EM signal. With a large number of inclusion crystals (here in the hundreds), it is found that the impact on effective permittivity from differences in individual inclusion shapes is negligible.\n",

      "Raw       : To fulfil the tight area and memory constraints in IoT applications, the design of efficient Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) hardware becomes crucial. Quantization of CNN is one of the promising approach that allows the compression of large CNN into a much smaller one, which is very suitable for IoT applications. Among various proposed quantization schemes, Power-of-two (PoT) quantization enables efficient hardware implementation and small memory consumption for CNN accelerators, but requires retraining of CNN to retain its accuracy. This paper proposes a two-level post-training static quantization technique (DoubleQ) that combines the 8-bit and PoT weight quantization. The CNN weight is first quantized to 8-bit (level one), then further quantized to PoT (level two). This allows multiplication to be carried out using shifters, by expressing the weights in their PoT exponent form. DoubleQ also reduces the memory storage requirement for CNN, as only the exponent of the weights is needed for storage. However, DoubleQ trades the accuracy of the network for reduced memory storage. To recover the accuracy, a selection process (DoubleQExt) was proposed to strategically select some of the less informative layers in the network to be quantized with PoT at the second level. On ResNet-20, the proposed DoubleQ can reduce the memory consumption by 37.50% with 7.28% accuracy degradation compared to 8-bit quantization. By applying DoubleQExt, the accuracy is only degraded by 1.19% compared to 8-bit version while achieving a memory reduction of 23.05%. This result is also 1% more accurate than the state-of-the-art work (SegLog). The proposed DoubleQExt also allows flexible configuration to trade off the memory consumption with better accuracy, which is not found in the other state-of-the-art works. With the proposed two-level weight quantization, one can achieve a more efficient hardware architecture for CNN with minimal impact to the accuracy, which is crucial for IoT applicati...\n",

      "Raw       : Enterprises exist in a competitive manufacturing environment. To reduce production costs and effectively use production capacity to improve competitiveness, a hybrid production system is necessary. The flexible job shop (FJS) is a hybrid production system, and the FJS problem (FJSP) has drawn considerable attention in the past few decades. This paper examined the FJSP and, like previous studies, aimed to minimize the total order completion time (makespan). We developed a novel method that involves encoding feasible solutions in the genes of the initial chromosomes of a genetic algorithm (GA) and embedding the Taguchi method behind mating to increase the effectiveness of the GA. Two numerical experiments were conducted for evaluating the performance of the proposed algorithm relative to that of the Brandimarte MK1â€“MK10 benchmarks. The first experiment involved comparing the proposed algorithm and the traditional GA. The second experiment entailed comparing the proposed algorithm with those presented in previous studies. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is superior to those reported in previous studies (except for that of Zhang et al.: the results in experiment MK7 were superior to those of Zhang, the results in experiments MK6 and MK10 were slightly inferior to those of Zhang, and the results were equivalent in other experiments) and effectively overcomes the encoding problem that occurs when a GA is used to solve the FJSP.\n",
